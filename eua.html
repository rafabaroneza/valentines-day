                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn Unlike our Valentine's Day, Valentine's Day is known in the US and Europe on &nbsp &nbspFebruary 14th and has a very interesting and very old history.
				<p>Celebrated since the 5th century, Valentine's Day was named after a priest in Rome, who was observed in the 3rd century.</p> 
			</p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe story goes that the then emperor of the Italian capital, Claudius II, banned marriages on the pretext that married men end up becoming weaker soldiers, since single men without family commitments would do better in the army.
				
				Contrary to the monarch's orders, Valentine believed that marriage was part of God's plan and that it gave meaning to the world. Therefore, he continues to perform secret marriage ceremonies.
				
				It didn't take long for Claudius II to find out about the priest's plan and sentence him to death. However, during the period in which he was imprisoned, Valentim fell in love with the jailer's daughter and on the day of her execution, envied a letter to the girl signing "from your Valentine" - which originated the practice of sending cards to those you love on the day of your death. February 14th.
		</p>In ancient Rome, on February 15, the festival of Lupercalia celebrated fertility, with rituals to ensure it.
		<p>In the United States, Valentine's Day was adopted around the 18th century, and the tradition of cards and gifts grew, especially after 1840.</p>
		<br>
		<h1 class="fontes">DATE TRADITIONS</h1>
		<p>The Valentine's Day became a major commercial holiday, with shops and restaurants packed. </p>
		<p>Traditional gifts such as chocolates, flowers, jewelry and lingerie are often given to women who, in turn, also give gifts to their loved ones.</p>
		<p>Handmade cards are also highly valued, as proof that time has been invested in thinking about the person and creating something that is unique to the couple.</p>
		<p>This is because Valentine’s Day in the USA is used to talk about love in general, including with regard to family and friends.</p>
		<p>In schools, children make cards by hand and exchange sweets with their peers. Teenagers, on the other hand, tend to use a version of the “Love Mail” (present at Brazilian June festivals), with girls dressed as Cupid delivering secret romantic messages between students.</p>
		Although it is a famous celebration in the United States, there are reports that the first Valentine's letter was written in France in 1415, when the Duke of Orléans was sending love letters to his wife from prison.
<br>Nowadays, the French village called Valentine becomes the epicenter of romance between the 12th and 14th of February every year. Homes, gardens, trees and public spaces are decorated with cards, roses and marriage proposals. In addition, some couples follow the tradition of planting a small tree on the date, representing the love shared by them.
